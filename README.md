# AI Vendor Risk Assessment

## Overview
This project contains a detailed risk assessment for onboarding a thirdâ€‘party AI analytics vendor at a logistics startup. The vendor processes GPS data, driver schedules, and delivery logs to optimize routesâ€”but handling that data brings security, privacy, and compliance considerations.This assessment identifies key risks, scores them using a standardized model, and maps our findings to ISOÂ 27001:2022, NIST CSF, and GDPR principles.
